# NFCBusiness
## Overview
In order to stand out to potential employers I wanted to create my own variation on the PCB business card. I wanted my badge to do more than just look intresting. However, batteries are bulky and expensive. With the sheer number of phones equiped with Google pay/apple pay NFC in phones is becoming increasingly common. I think this makes NFC equiped PCB business cards a natural combination.

## RF430
This project uses a clever little chip, the RF430FRL154HCRGER. This chip is a variant on TI's MSP430. This one combines a NFC RF front end with a MSP430. We will be programming with a JTAG header and I will be building an accompanying POGO pin programming jig.

## Status
